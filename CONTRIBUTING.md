# H1 - Main Title (only one per file)

**Bold** for emphasis
`code` for commands and file names
```code blocks``` for multi-line commands

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

````markdown
# Good - with language
```bash
msfconsole -q
```

# Bad - no language
```
msfconsole -q
```
````

### Tables

Use tables for command references:

```markdown
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `cmd1` | Does X | `cmd1 -option` |
| `cmd2` | Does Y | `cmd2 value` |
```

### Emojis

Use emojis consistently:

| Emoji | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| 🔴 | Exploitation/Attack |
| 🔍 | Reconnaissance |
| 🌐 | Web/Network |
| 🔓 | Credentials/Access |
| ⚠️ | Warning |
| 💡 | Tip |
| ✅ | Do/Good |
| ❌ | Don't/Bad |
| 📋 | Reference |
| 🎯 | Target/Goal |
